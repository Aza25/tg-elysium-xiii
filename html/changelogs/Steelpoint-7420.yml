# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# INDENT WITH TWO SPACES.  NOT TABS.  SPACES.
# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.
# Also, this gets changed to [] after reading.  Just remove the brackets when you add new shit.
# Please surround your changes in single (') or double quotes ("). It works without them, but if you use certain characters it screws up compiling. The quotes will not show up in the changelog.
changes: 
  - rscadd: SS13's Head of Security has received a new attempted 1:1 recreation of a Old Earth weapon, the Captain's Antique Laser Gun.
  - rscadd: This gun features three firing modes, Tase, Laser and Disable. However this gun lacks the capability to recharge in the field, and is extreamly expensive.
