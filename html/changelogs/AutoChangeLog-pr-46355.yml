  - balance: "Omega weed has lost its haloperidol, capsaicin, barber's aid, itching powder, and histamine chemical production traits. In exchange, it's received the nicotine production trait as an additional chemical production trait. The chemical production traits that were in omega weed before this change but were not mentioned in the above list are still in omega weed."
  - balance: "The list of chemical production traits of rainbow weed has been changed from 15% mindbreaker toxin and 35% lipolicide to 5% colorful reagent, 3% psicodine, 10% happiness, 10% mindbreaker toxin, and 15% lipolicide. This should make ingesting rainbow weed change your character's color, but should also make 100 potency rainbow weed highly addictive."
  - balance: "The extradimensional orange has received the 15% haloperidol chemical production trait that omega weed used to have."
