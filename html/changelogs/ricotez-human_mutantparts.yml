     - rscadd: "Added two categories of mutant bodyparts for humans with the same system that lizards use: ears and tails. You cannot access these categories at round start, but admins can edit them in the DNA for special events."
     - rscadd: "Updated the system that checks for which jobs your character qualifies to be species-dependant. At this moment you won't notice any differences, but in the future coders can use this to be more specific about which jobs a species is allowed in under which circumstances."
     - imageadd: "Added one option to both categories, taken from the kitty ears: a long, simple tail and cat ears. An admin can give a human the tail by setting the value for 'tail_human' to 'Long and Smooth', and the ears by setting the value for 'ears' to 'Cat'. Mark the capital letters."
     - wip: "Adding categories for tattoos and scars is in the works. (Read: I need sprites!)"
