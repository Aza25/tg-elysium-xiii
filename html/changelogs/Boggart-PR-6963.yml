  - rscadd: "Adds a new spell: Repulse. (Cooldown: 40 seconds, 15 at max upgrade.) Repulse throws objects and creatures within 5 tiles of the caster away and stuns them for a very short time. Distance thrown decreases as the distance from the caster increases. (Max of 5, minimum of 3) Casting it while standing over someone will stun them for longer and cause brute damage but will not throw them."
