changes: 
  - balance: "The way that a virus's transmission-based infection vectors are determined has been altered."
  - balance: "The sneezing symptom now spreads the virus in a cone, instead of in all directions."
  - balance: "The sneezing symptom now has a very special threshold effect that requires the virus to have a stage speed of 17 (yes, 17, not 7) in order for it to be activated."
  - balance: "The coughing symptom now spreads the virus in a 1 tile radius square around the host without any thresholds needing to be met."
  - balance: "The coughing symptom's resistance 3 threshold (the one that make hosts drop small items) is now a resistance 11 threshold."
  - balance: "Other alterations have been made to the thresholds and threshold effects of the sneezing and coughing symptoms."
  - tweak: "Various descriptions have been updated."
  - tweak: "The name of the viral DNA activator symptom has been changed to \"dormant DNA activator\", to avoid confusion with the viral self-adaptation and viral evolutionary acceleration symptoms."
  - balance: "The dormant DNA activator symptom now activates as often as it should."
