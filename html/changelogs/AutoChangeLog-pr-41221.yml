  - tweak: "Revenants now only use stolen essence to unlock new spells. No more counting corpses or waiting for regen before draining."
  - tweak: "Spell unlock costs adjusted accordingly, defile upped from 0 to a cost of 10."
  - balance: "Reduced blight cost to 75, more in line with its underwhelming nature."
  - tweak: "Drain targets in soft-crit will be stunned, to prevent them crawling away."
