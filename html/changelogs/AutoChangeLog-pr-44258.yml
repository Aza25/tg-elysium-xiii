  - refactor: "how to make a custom primed grenade now: apply wire, apply beakers, interact with the wire by multitool or hitting the grenade with an assembly, attach assembly to wire.\\n
if its an proxy sensor when you prime it it ll activate the activation mode of the sensor with whatever time it was set in the prox sensor ( you can screwdrive to speed set it to 5 or 3 s)\\n
if its a timer it ll change the det_time to whatever the timer had( you can screwdrive to speed set it to 5 or 3 s)\\n"
