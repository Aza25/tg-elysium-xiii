  - bugfix: "Ever since Centcom got their own supplypod cannon, they've neglected any of the station's requests for supply-pod delivered orders. The operators responsible have been fired (out of an airlock) and replaced with better ones. As such, Express Consoles work again."
  - admin: "Also, the centcom podlauncher verb no longer spams \"Explosion with size (0,0,0)\""
