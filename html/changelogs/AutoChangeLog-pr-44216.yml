  - balance: "HoS gun has ion mode to replace taser mode, which fires weak ion bolts (ion bolts with 0 heavy and light range)"
  - tweak: "HoS gun now cycles disabler -> laser -> ion"
  - bugfix: "spiral_range properly includes turf contents if dist = 0"
  - bugfix: "weak ion bolts are no longer stronger than strong ion bolts"
