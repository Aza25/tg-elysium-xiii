  - tweak: "Each shot glass now holds 15 units. This means you can mix certain shots (namely, the B-52 and Toxins Special) in a shot glass. Both drinks have been made exclusive to shot glasses and will no longer show their specific sprite in a normal glass."
  - tweak: "Reduced chance to get drunk at lower alcohol levels. This is the beginning of an overhaul of the drunkenness system - eventually it will entirely be based on how much alcohol is in your system, as opposed to RNG."
  - rscadd: "Added new sprites for vodka, whiskey, rum and water in shot glasses. Everything else will show up as 'shot of booze'."
  - bugfix: "Fixed shot glasses turning into regular glasses when filled."
  - bugfix: "Fixed tequila bottle sprites not showing up."
