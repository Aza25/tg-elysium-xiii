  - rscadd: "Golems' mining IDs are now linked to the Liberator's account."
  - tweak: "Half of the gulag points earned go to the prisoner as cash and the other half is put into the security budget, unless the prisoner's real ID is not in the gulag reclamation console in which case the full sum is awarded to the prisoner."
