changes: 
  - imageadd: "Added condiment bottle reagent overlays for reagents without special bottle sprites"
  - rscadd: "Made it so you can rename or change the description of condiment bottles with a pen"
  - balance: "You can no longer tell the main or only reagent in a condiment bottle through the description. This is in line with other reagent containers."
  - spellcheck: "Fixed some typos/punched descriptions up a little"
  - tweak: "Sprites of roundstart condiment containers (e.g. salt, milk, flour) are no longer static and change based on the reagent with the largest volume as well now"
  - tweak: "Sugar comes in a bag rather than a bottle"
  - tweak: "Bottles will turn into flour, rice, milk or soymilk containers if they are the largest reagent in them"
