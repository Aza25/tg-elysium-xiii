  - rscdel: "Salbu has been replaced in all roundstart items with the PERFect chem"
  - rscadd: "Salbu is now a T3 sleeper upgrade"
  - balance: "Perf now converts O2 deprivation to lesser amounts of Toxin more evenly than before"
  - rscadd: "Perf effects scale based on O2 deprivation and how long perf is in your system"
  - balance: "Perf now has a 35u OD which ignores O2dep adjustment (You will take scaled toxin damage regardless of healed oxygen damage)"
