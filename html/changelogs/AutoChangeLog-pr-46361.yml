changes: 
  - rscadd: "Plasma now \"boils\" at 50C. This means you will need to heat the liquid form up to make it into a gas (previously you could just splash it)"
  - tweak: "containers that halt reactions (IE cryostasis beakers) will keep reagents at a set temperature."
  - bugfix: "Plasma will no longer summon gas whenever transferring via syringe. AKA you can now do xenobio again."
  - bugfix: "Plasma can no longer be cheesed grenade-style by heating the beaker. It will now require reaction/pyrotechnics."
  - code_imp: "Reagents now have the framework to perform different effects on temperature change."
